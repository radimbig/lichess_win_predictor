#THIS IS CLONE WITHOUT USING THIRD-PARTIES API
1.To use this program you should get an API token" from\
[Lichess API](https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token)\
it only requires READ permissions\
2 Create file with token\
`echo your_token > token.txt`\
3 You should download [stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/ \) from and name it stockfish.exe, I used 17 \
4 Start your game and then start my program by\
`dotnet run`\
Optionally you can set refresh rate in milliseconds just in second line of token.txt file\


#Problem:
I don't know how to normalize stockfish output\
I will be happy to receive solution to this one.
